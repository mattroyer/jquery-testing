# Learning jQuery

This is my own sample code for jQuery. I need a hands-on approach when learning something, so here is the fruits of my labor. I will continue to add to these documents as much as I can.

Here are the following things these documents do so far:

* The Header text fades in
* Clicking on a line of text in the main body will make it re-enter itself one character at a time. The function I built to do this actually splits up a string in the html document on the fly
* Clicking on the Home | About links makes the links switch places with each other
* Right-clicking on the About link will load the main content from the about.html page into the main content on this page
* Clicking on the Powered text at the bottom of the screen makes it fade out and back in, putting "Animation complete!" in the .second class
* Pressing the H key when you are not in a text field will bring you to the index.html page
* Clicking the YourName link at the bottom of the page brings up a text box for you to enter your name. All .yourName class texts change to the value you enter

Feel free to copy any code you find in here, change it, and mess with it in any way you would like. Please fork this project and help me grow the samples. Also, please correct my code if it is incorrect.
